CS-370-X6160 Current/Emerging Trends in CS 23EW6

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was given a Jupyter Notebook Python code where I implemented an algorithm for a reinforcement-learning routine that helped to find a path through a maze.
To write maintainable, readable, modular software applications, I develop code into separate functions and classes within the program. The module I created for the project contains all the repetitive database access logic into simple functions. This made the main code much cleaner and allowed the functions to be easily reused. To extend this module's capabilities, I added error-handling logic to make sure that errors were easily located.

As a computer scientist, I take a methodical, step-by-step approach to solving problems. For this project, I broke down the requirements into logical components such as R-Learning functions, dashboard layout drivers, and widgets. By tackling each piece incrementally and testing frequently, I could iterate on each component and verify that they operated correctly. I find this approach less overwhelming than trying to solve everything at once. In the future, I will take a similar path for any complex problem - breaking it down into smaller parts that can be developed and tested more easily.

Computer scientists design and build software systems that help people and organizations achieve their goals more efficiently and effectively.  By providing a systematic way to train an AI with reinforcement-learning data, and generate insightful reports, this software saves employees time and gives owners and shareholders better insight into the business. Well-designed programs can free us from repetitive or complex tasks while leveraging the strengths of various algorithms that simplify data processing while improving accuracy. Developing maintainable, modular software to more easily solve problems is at the heart of what we, as computer scientists, do.




What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists analyze problems, design solutions, write code, and consider ethical implications to create innovative and responsible solutions that benefit society while upholding ethical standards.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilities in computer science are essential, especially concerning end users and organizations:

User Well-being: Prioritize the safety and well-being of users by creating systems that protect their privacy, security, and overall experience.

Transparency and Accountability: Clearly communicate the capabilities and limitations of systems, ensuring users understand how their data is used and processed.

Bias and Fairness: Mitigate biases in algorithms and systems to avoid discrimination and ensure fairness in outcomes.

Data Privacy: Handle user data responsibly, following legal and ethical standards, and respecting user preferences.

Societal Impact: Consider the broader societal implications of technology and strive to create solutions that have positive effects on communities and society as a whole.

Continuous Learning: Stay updated on the latest ethical guidelines, technological advancements, and potential risks to make informed decisions.
