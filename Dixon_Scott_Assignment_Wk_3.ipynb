    "# The algorithm used in this script, which can distinguish realistic images, has the potential to be used to distinguish people's faces. The potential for algorithms to improve individual and social welfare comes with significant ethical risks (Floridi and Taddeo, 2016). Algorithms are not ethically neutral. While solutions to these issues are being discussed and designed, the number of algorithmic systems exhibiting ethical problems continues to grow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Work on the ethics of algorithms has increased significantly since 2016, when national governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private companies started to take a prominent role in the conversation on “fair” and “ethical” AI and algorithms (Sandvig et al. 2016).  \n",
    "\n",
    "# A few issues and potential problems exist with the use of an image recognition algorithm and include the following categories:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#  Informed Consent: One of the primary ethical concerns is the lack of informed consent. If an algorithm can recognize and identify individuals without their knowledge or consent, it violates their right to privacy.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Surveillance and Tracking: The widespread adoption of facial recognition technology could lead to an increase in surveillance and tracking capabilities by both public and private entities. This could have serious implications for civil liberties, as individuals may feel constantly monitored and their movements scrutinized.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Bias and Discrimination: Facial recognition algorithms have been shown to exhibit possible bias, particularly against certain racial and ethnic groups. Numerous studies and real-world examples have demonstrated higher error rates and misidentification of individuals with darker skin tones. This can lead to unjust targeting, false accusations, and create increased societal biases and discrimination.    \n",
    "\n",
    "# Misuse of Data: The emergence of vast amounts of data, due in part to the use of smart devices, social media and existing databases, allows for new technologies to access the data. (Allam and Jones, 2020). The storage and processing of facial recognition data pose significant privacy risks. The collected data could be susceptible to breaches or unauthorized access, leading to identity theft, stalking, or other malicious activities.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Lack of Regulation and Oversight: The rapid advancement of facial recognition technology has outpaced the development of adequate regulations and oversight mechanisms. Recent literature suggests that several factors contribute to the prevailing issue of algorithmic transparency, accountability, and safeguards. (Diakopoulos and Koliska, 2017).  \n",
